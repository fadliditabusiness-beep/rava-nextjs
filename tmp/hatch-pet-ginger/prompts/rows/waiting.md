Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `ginger`, state `waiting`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 6 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure blue #0000FF. Treat the row as 6 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: Keep Ginger as a compact whole-body orange tabby-and-white cat: orange coat with subtle tabby striping, white chest and paws, wide dark eyes, a small pink nose, upright ears, and a curved tail. Preserve realistic soft fur in a polished stylized pet-sprite look.. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `auto`: Infer the most appropriate pet-safe style from the user request and reference images, then keep that exact style consistent across every row. User style notes: Stylized, soft, friendly non-pixel pet sprite derived from the supplied cat; crisp silhouette and large readable features at small size..
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Needs-input loop: expectant asking pose for approval, help, or user input.

State requirements:
- Show that Codex needs approval, help, or user input through an expectant asking pose.
- Keep the motion patient and readable, without turning it into ordinary idle or review.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.
